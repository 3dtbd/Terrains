Unity Heightmaps, Terrains, Textures, models and configuration files for environment tools in the Unity Asset Store.

# Quickstart

This repository has everything you need to edit the terrains included, but if you simply want to grab a terrain and use it in your project then see the packages in `Assets/Wizards Code/Terains/Terrain Packages/`. Here you will find Unity Packages that contain some of the terrains built in this project. However, please note that some of them use assets that are not open source. The package names indicate if they have any textures or models included in the terrain data. These packages DO NOT include the assets themselves, unless they are open source and included in this repository.

At present we don't clearly indicate which are using open source and which are not, you can only find out by trying them. We'll get more organized in time.

# Terrains

In the `WizardsCode/Terrains/Scenes` folder you will find a number of terrains for your use. For the most part you will want to use these as heightmaps and apply your own texturing and vegetation. However, many of the terrains also come with versions that use a set of open source textures and models to demostrate what they might look like when planted.

# Textures

In the `WizardsCode/Terrains/Textures` folder you will find some open source and public domain textures for use on terrains.

# Models

In the `WizardsCode/Terrains/Models` folder you will find some open source and public domain models that can be used to spice up your terrain. You'll find some trees, grasses and even some buildings and furniture.

# Gaia Biomes

Included in this repo are some Biome configurations for [Gaia Pro](http://bit.ly/GaiaProAsset) and [Gaia](https://bit.ly/Gaia2Unity). You can find the biomes in the `Assets/WizardsCode/Terrains/Data/Gaia` folder. Obviously you will need to buy Gaia and any asset packs they use to make use of them. See the README.md in each folder for links to required packs.

For example, there is a Biome for the excellent [Tropical Forest Pack](https://bit.ly/UnityTFP) that you can see in action in our [Speed Build - Tropical Terrain using Gaia, Tropical Forrest Pack and Enviro](https://youtu.be/zciz3ZLNjJk) video. There are deeper dive videos on that channel too.

# Enviro: Sky and Weather

The `Assets/WizardsCode/Terrains/Data/Enviro` folder includes some profiles for Enviro. These make for a great starting point for your own work with [Enviro: Sky and Weather](https://bit.ly/UnityEnviro).

If you are building a Tropical Forest then you can checkout our tropical Enviro profile in our [Speed Build - Tropical Terrain using Gaia, Tropical Forrest Pack and Enviro](https://youtu.be/zciz3ZLNjJk) video.

# Vegetation Studio Pro

The `Assets/WizardsCode/Terrains/Data/VSPro Biomes` folder has some profiles for Vegetation Studio Pro that you can use to texture and plant your scenes. Check the README in each folder to see if there are any required asset packs for the models and textures.

# Tools

## Terrain Exporter

This tool will export your heightmap, optionally with the splatmap, details and trees as a package for each transfer to another project.

To use: Tools -> Wizard Code -> Terrain Exporter (Instructions are in the exporter window)

# Resources

We gather resources from a number of places. Some of the assets on this site require attribution but none restrict the creation of derivatives. Even when attribution is not required we do our best to ensure license and attribution information is provided in the directory the asset is found, please be sure to adhere to the license when you reuse these assets. If you believe any asset included here is not under a sufficiently open license please let us know so we can validate and, if necessary, remove the asset.

Here's a list of the sites and artists we use (in alphabetic order).

# Unity Asset Store Affiliate Links

We try to make as much of this content usable without spending money on assets. However, assets will make things easier and often better. All links in this project to assets are affiliate links. By using these links when you buy assets (any assets, not just the ones linked) will give me a small commission. Please consider using them so I can continue to provide this stuff.
