# Gaia Biomes

Included in this repo are some Biomes configurations for [Gaia Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gaia-pro-terrain-scene-generator-155852?aid=1101l866w) and [Gaia](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gaia-2-terrain-scene-generator-42618?aid=1101l866w). You can find the biomes in the [Assets/Gaia](https://github.com/3dtbd/Terrains/tree/master/Assets/Gaia) folder. Obviously you will need to buy Gaia and any asset packs they use to make use of them. See the README.md in each folder for links to required packs.
