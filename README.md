Unity Heightmaps, Terrains and Gaia Biomes.

# Submodules

This repository uses a set of submodules, be sure to check out with:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules [repo URI]
```
# Terrains

In the [AssetsScenes](https://github.com/3dtbd/Terrains/tree/master/Assets/Scenes) you will find a number of terrains for your use. For the most part you will want to use these as heightmaps and apply your own texturing and vegetation. However, many of the terrains also come with versions that use a set of open source textures and models to demostrate what they might look like when planted. These assets are included as submobules so be sure to check them out (see above).

# Gaia Biomes

Included in this repo are some Biomes configurations for [Gaia Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gaia-pro-terrain-scene-generator-155852?aid=1101l866w) and [Gaia](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gaia-2-terrain-scene-generator-42618?aid=1101l866w). You can find the biomes in the [Assets/Gaia](https://github.com/3dtbd/Terrains/tree/master/Assets/Gaia) folder. Obviously you will need to buy Gaia and any asset packs they use to make use of them. See the README.md in each folder for links to required packs.
